# LogicWorld-UltraSaveFixer (for servers)
Increases the max allowed world save time from 300ms to much more (150 000ms by default) to prevent the save-game spiral that can lag out your server to the point where TPS drops significantly (to like one or two TPS).

# Install
Put the contents of the "mod" directory into a new folder inside your server's GameData folder.

You will also need to install the "ServerOnlyMods" mod made by Ecconia: https://github.com/Ecconia/Ecconia-LogicWorld-Mods/tree/master/ServerOnlyMods
